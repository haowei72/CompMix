\arguments{
\item{y}{A vector of either continuous or binary values to indicate the health outcome}

\item{x}{A matrix of numeric values to indicate the chemical mixtures}

\item{z}{A matrix of numeric values to indicate the covariates}

\item{y.type}{A character value of either "continuous" or "binary"}

\item{test.pct}{A numeric scalar between 0 and 1 to indicate the proportion allocated as test samples}

\item{interaction}{A logical value (TRUE/FALSE) to indicate whether to include
pairwise interaction terms between all the chemical mixtures x}

\item{interaction.exp.cov}{A logical value (TRUE/FALSE) to indicate whether to include
pairwise interaction terms between all the chemical mixtures x and covariates z. If interaction.exp.cov=TRUE,
interaction=TURE or interaction=FALSE will be ignored}

\item{covariates.forcein}{A logical value (TRUE/FALSE) to indicate whether to force in any covariates}

\item{bkmr.pip}{A numeric scalar between 0 and 1 to indicate the cutoff for the
posterior inclusion probability in BKMR}

\item{bkmr.iter}{A positive integer to indicate the number of MCMC iterations for bkmr}
}
\value{
A list object which may contain up to 8 cases
\describe{
\item{Case 1}{variable selection on main effects for exposures and confounders}


}

Each case may contain some of the following elements
\describe{
\item{betaest}{a numeric vector of coeffcients for the exposures}
\item{z_betaest}{a numeric vector of coeffcients for the covariates}
\item{sse}{A positive scalar to indicate sum of squares error}
\item{corr}{A numeric scalar between -1 and 1 to indicate correlation coefficient}
}

#Example 1: The users would like to perform variable selections on main effects of exposures and covariates, and outcome, exposures and covariates are entered. For any individual interactions that the users would like to include in the models, they can add those into the covariate z.
res_ex1 <- Comp.Mix(y=dat$y, x=dat$x, z=dat$z, test.pct=0.5, var.select = TRUE, interaction = FALSE, covariates.forcein = FALSE, bkmr.pip=0.5, seed=2023)
#Results include exposures and covariates that are selected and their coefficients  by Lasso and Elastic-net, as well as sum-squared errors and correlations calculated from the testing data for model comparisons.
